# Bash-Script-portfolio
My name is Rishika Santhosh Kumar. Welcome to my bash script portfolio. During my internship at 365 Retail Markets, this was an assignment to demonastrate my skills using shell. 
This script will take you through riddles to know more about me. You can have many attempts to get it right. At the end, there should be a contact signature.

(HINT: one word answers, first letter capital)
Good Luck!

# How to run bash script
